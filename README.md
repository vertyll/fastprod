## Project Assumptions

Production management application.

## Link: https://fastprod.vertyll.dev

## Technology Stack

### Back-end:

- Spring Boot.
- Java.
- Gradle Kotlin DSL.
- JDBC.
- JPA.
- Hibernate.
- PostgreSQL.
- JUnit.
- Mockito.
- Lombok.
- Spring Security.
- Spring Data.
- Spring Web.
- Keycloak.
- Flyway.
- OpenAPI (Swagger).

### Front-end:

- Vaadin (Java-only – Flow).
- Spring Boot.
- Java.
- Gradle Kotlin DSL.
- JUnit.
- Mockito.
- Lombok.
- Spring Web.

### Authentication:

- **Identity provider**: Keycloak (realm `fastprod`) owns every page that touches a credential: sign-up, sign-in, email
  verification, password reset, two-factor authentication and acceptance of the terms of use. The application never sees
  a password.
- **Pattern**: BFF. The Vaadin front-end signs users in with the authorization code flow and PKCE and keeps the tokens
  in its server-side session; the browser holds only the `FASTPROD_SESSION` cookie (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure`
  in production), and Vaadin protects every request against CSRF.
- **Session store**: the front-end's memory (Vaadin keeps the UI state on the server anyway), so a restart signs users
  out.
- **JWT**: the front-end calls the back-end with the Keycloak access token. The back-end is a stateless OAuth2 resource
  server: it verifies the token's signature (Keycloak's JWKS), issuer, expiry and audience (`fastprod-api`) and takes
  the roles (`ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`, `USER`) from it.
- **Token lifecycle**: access tokens live five minutes; every refresh returns a new refresh token and invalidates the
  old one, and concurrent requests of one session share a single refresh. Signing out revokes the refresh token at
  Keycloak.
- **Accounts**: the back-end creates the local account in PostgreSQL on the first request and mirrors names and roles
  from the token. Administrators create employees through the Keycloak Admin API with a temporary password.

### Core back-end:

- Gradle multi-module build system.
- The application has an exception handling mechanism.
- The application has a logging mechanism.
- The application has separate environments for local and prod.
- The application has a dedicated configuration file.
- The application has RBAC (Role Based Access Control).
- The application has an audit mechanism (who and when modified data).
- The application has Flyway database migration mechanism.
- And many other features that can be found in the application code.

### Other:

- Docker for development environment.
- PMD for static code analysis.
- SpotBugs for static code analysis.
- JSpecify for null-safety annotations.
- NullAway for null-safety checks.
- Error Prone for static code analysis.
